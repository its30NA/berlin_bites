## 📌 Overview

**Berlin Bites** is an ongoing solo project building a smart restaurant discovery platform for Berlin.  
It combines curated recommendations, mapping, and early **NLP-powered review analysis** to deliver more meaningful suggestions than standard list-based apps.

This repository contains data exploration, pipeline design, and early prototypes as the project evolves toward a full MVP.

## ✨ Features (WIP)

- **Restaurant Discovery** — Curated recommendations across Berlin’s neighborhoods.  
- **Map Integration** — Location-based browsing (planned).  
- **Personalized Suggestions** — Taste profiles, filters, and preferences (in development).
